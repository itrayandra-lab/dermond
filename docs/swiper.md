The Swiper repository contains the source code, build processes, and documentation for the Swiper library. This library provides a mobile-first touch slider for web, mobile, and hybrid applications, offering touch-enabled carousel functionalities and hardware-accelerated transitions.

The repository manages the full lifecycle of the Swiper library. This includes processes for building JavaScript modules, processing CSS styles, and generating TypeScript declaration files. An automated workflow handles library releases, and separate scripts manage sponsor information and provide real-time feedback during development. For further details on these processes, see [Swiper Library Development and Release](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release).

Swiper implements mobile touch slider functionalities, focusing on native-like behaviors and hardware-accelerated transitions. Foundational CSS in [`src/swiper.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css) defines the visual presentation and theming capabilities. The library's modular architecture allows extensions for various effects, accessibility, and user interaction. [Swiper Core Implementation and Styling](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-core-implementation-and-styling) and [Swiper Module Integrations and Styling](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-module-integrations-and-styling) describe these aspects.

TypeScript type definitions are central to the library, providing type safety and enhancing development across its core features, modules, and framework integrations. These definitions include the main [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class, event interfaces, configuration options, and module-specific types. Refer to [TypeScript Type Definitions](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#typescript-type-definitions) for a complete overview.

The repository also includes numerous demonstrations and a development playground. Demonstrations illustrate various functionalities, usage patterns, and advanced effects. The playground provides dedicated environments for testing Swiper's integration with frameworks such as React and Vue.js, along with core JavaScript and Web Components. For examples and testing setups, see [Swiper Demonstrations and Examples](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-demonstrations-and-examples) and [Development and Testing Playground](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#development-and-testing-playground).

Swiper Library Development and Release
--------------------------------------

The Swiper library's development lifecycle encompasses its build, release, core functionalities, and supporting scripts. This process is managed from the root directory, [`(root)`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/), which also facilitates community engagement through contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and sponsor recognition.

The build and release processes are primarily managed by scripts located in the [`scripts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts) directory. These scripts coordinate various tasks, such as cleaning output directories, copying assets, and initiating builds for JavaScript modules, TypeScript declarations, and CSS styles.

During the build process, JavaScript modules, including core components and framework-specific versions, are compiled, bundled, and minified using tools like Rollup, Babel, and Terser. This process also involves injecting styles and adding banners to the generated files, orchestrated by the [`buildModules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-modules.js#L16) function in [`scripts/build-modules.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-modules.js). CSS styles undergo processing for core, bundled, and module-specific components, including autoprefixing, minification, and advanced transformations for Shadow DOM compatibility, as managed by the [`buildStyles`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js#L45) function in [`scripts/build-styles.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js) and associated utilities in [`scripts/utils`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils). TypeScript declaration files ([`.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L19)) are generated for React, Vue, and Web Components, adapting event typings to framework-specific conventions and injecting them into base type definition files, using the [`buildTypes`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-types.js#L11) function in [`scripts/build-types.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-types.js). These build steps are orchestrated by [`scripts/build.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js).

The release process is automated, involving version prompting, updating [`package.json`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L479) files, performing Git operations (commit, tag, push), running production builds, and publishing the library to npm. This is handled by the [`release`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js#L12) function in [`scripts/release.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js).

Sponsor information is dynamically managed by the [`buildSponsors`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-sponsors.js#L106) function in [`scripts/build-sponsors.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-sponsors.js), which fetches data from an API, processes it, and updates [`BACKERS.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/BACKERS.md) and [`README.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md) with categorized sponsor lists.

During development, a file watcher script, [`scripts/watch.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js), monitors changes in source files within [`src`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src) and automatically triggers incremental rebuilds of styles, types, and modules via the [`watchFunction`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L11).

The project maintains a changelog in [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md) to document version updates, bug fixes, and new features. The project's approach to contributions and community interaction is outlined in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) respectively, with [`CODE_CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CODE_CONTRIBUTORS.md) acknowledging contributors. The main [`README.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md) provides an overview of Swiper's features, usage, and development process.

### Build Process Orchestration

The build process coordinates the creation of the Swiper library, distinguishing between production and development needs. The central component for this orchestration is the [`Build`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js#L10) class, defined in [`scripts/build.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js). This class manages the execution of various build tasks, such as compiling JavaScript modules, generating TypeScript declaration files, and processing CSS styles.

The [`Build`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js#L10) class includes an [`add`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js#L17) method to register individual build functions and a [`run`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js#L22) method to execute them. For production builds, the process begins by ensuring a clean output directory. This involves removing any existing output directory and then recreating it, after which necessary static assets are copied into this fresh output location. The registered build functions, which handle the specific compilation of modules, types, and styles, are then executed. Error handling is integrated to report any issues during this process.

During development, the build can be initiated without the full cleanup and recreation steps, allowing for faster iterations. This differentiation is controlled by the [`isProd`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/isProd.js#L1) flag, defined in [`scripts/utils/isProd.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/isProd.js), which determines if the [`--prod`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/isProd.js#L3) argument was passed to the Node.js process. The overall build duration is logged using a time-tracking utility, providing insight into the efficiency of the process.

### JavaScript Module Bundling and Minification

The JavaScript module bundling and minification process for Swiper orchestrates the compilation, bundling, and optimization of JavaScript modules, including core components and framework-specific versions for React and Vue. This process uses a combination of [`rollup`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L72), [`babel`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L68), and [`terser`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L106) to create optimized, production-ready assets.

The build begins by identifying Swiper modules from a configuration, which can be customized via environment variables (see [`scripts/build-config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-config.js)). It then prepares a core Swiper custom element bundle by modifying import paths within the source code that eventually becomes part of the custom element.

Bundling is primarily handled by [`rollup`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L72), which processes various entry points including the core Swiper library, its main bundle, custom elements, and integrations for Vue and React. During this bundling phase, a [`replace`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L42) plugin dynamically injects module import statements and installation calls into the output. A [`babel`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L68) plugin transpiles the code to ensure broad browser compatibility, and [`nodeResolve`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-modules.js#L4) assists in resolving module paths.

After the initial bundling, files are organized: individual Swiper modules are placed into a dedicated directory, shared dependencies are separated, and core Swiper files are positioned in the main distribution folder. During this phase, import paths within module files are corrected to ensure they correctly reference shared dependencies.

A key aspect of the process involves injecting CSS styles directly into custom element JavaScript files. This uses [`getElementStyles`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L111) from [`scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js) to retrieve pre-processed CSS strings for core, bundled, and slide elements, which are then embedded by replacing placeholders within files like [`swiper-element.mjs`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/copy/package.json#L55) and [`swiper-element-bundle.mjs`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L12).

A standard banner containing license and version information is prepended to each generated file. The process also generates IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) versions of key bundles for environments that may not fully support ES modules. This involves temporarily modifying export statements, bundling to IIFE format, and then reverting the changes in the ESM files.

Finally, in production mode, [`terser`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L106) minifies the generated JavaScript and ECMAScript module files across shared, modules, and root distribution directories. This reduces file sizes, improving load times and overall performance. Further details on the orchestration of these steps can be found in [Build Process Orchestration](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-build-process-orchestration). The utilities used in this process are detailed in [`scripts/utils`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils).

### CSS Style Processing and Generation

The processing and generation of CSS styles for the Swiper library involve a pipeline that handles core, bundled, and module-specific stylesheets, adapting them for various distribution needs, including compatibility with Shadow DOM. This process is primarily managed by [`scripts/build-styles.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js) and a suite of utility functions found in [`scripts/utils`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils).

The core of the CSS build process generates both [`swiper.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/copy/package.json#L26) (containing only the core Swiper styles) and [`swiper-bundle.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1963) (which integrates styles from all included modules). These outputs are produced in both standard and minified versions. The [`buildCSS`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js#L18) function within [`scripts/build-styles.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js) is responsible for aggregating CSS content, applying vendor prefixes using [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/package.json#L77) (from [`scripts/utils/autoprefixer.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/autoprefixer.js)), and minifying the output via [`minifyCSS`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js#L8) (from [`scripts/utils/minify-css.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/minify-css.js)). A standard banner with license and version information is also prepended to these files using the [`banner`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/banner.js#L12) utility from [`scripts/utils/banner.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/banner.js).

For production builds, the system extends its processing to individual module CSS files. This involves copying source CSS files from [`src`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src) to the output directory and then performing more advanced transformations. One significant aspect is adapting styles for Web Component environments and Shadow DOM compatibility. This is achieved by unwrapping nested CSS rules using [`unwrapCss`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js#L14) (from [`scripts/utils/unwrap-css.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/unwrap-css.js)) and then applying specific string replacements through [`getSplittedCSS`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L11) and [`proceedReplacements`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L40) (both from [`scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js)). These replacements convert standard CSS selectors like [`.swiper-slide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L50) into their Shadow DOM equivalents such as [`::slotted(swiper-slide)`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L52) or [`:host`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L8), ensuring that styles correctly target elements encapsulated within a Shadow Root. The processing also splits CSS into 'slides' and 'container' sections to allow for targeted transformations, and [`proceedSlideReplacements`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/get-element-styles.js#L79) handles specific adjustments for slide-related effects like 3D transforms and zoom containers. The [`less`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L39) utility from [`scripts/utils/less.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/utils/less.js) can also compile Less CSS into standard CSS as part of the overall style processing.

The entire orchestration of the build process, including style generation, is managed by [`scripts/build.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build.js), which coordinates various build tasks. For real-time development feedback, the [`scripts/watch.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js) script monitors changes in source files and triggers incremental rebuilds of styles, among other assets, as detailed in [Development File Watcher](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-development-file-watcher). This ensures that developers can see changes reflected quickly during active development.

### TypeScript Declaration File Generation

The generation of TypeScript declaration files ([`.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L19)) is handled through scripts that process source code to create type definitions for Swiper's core, modules, and framework integrations. These declaration files are crucial for providing type safety and autocompletion for developers utilizing Swiper in TypeScript projects.

The process involves consolidating type definitions from various sources:

*   **Core Swiper Types**: Found in [`src/types`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types), these files define the foundational [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class interface, including its properties, methods, and shared utility types. For example, the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) interface in [`src/types/swiper-class.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts) extends a base [`SwiperClass`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts#L28) to include all module-specific functionalities, centralizing the API.
*   **Event Definitions**: The [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) interface, defined in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts), aggregates core Swiper events with module-specific events, ensuring a comprehensive and type-safe mechanism for event handling across the library.
*   **Configuration Options**: The [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface, located in [`src/types/swiper-options.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts), outlines the extensive configuration properties available for a Swiper instance, integrating core settings with module-specific options.
*   **Module-Specific Types**: The directory [`src/types/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules) contains detailed type definitions for each Swiper module. Files like [`src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts) or [`src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts) define the methods, events, and configuration options specific to their respective modules. These individual module types are then re-exported through [`src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts) to provide a unified access point for all module-related type definitions.

This structured approach ensures that whether developers are using the core Swiper library, integrating specific modules, or working within frameworks like React or Vue, they have access to accurate and comprehensive type information, enhancing the development experience by catching type-related errors early and providing intelligent code suggestions. The process ultimately consolidates these definitions into [`index.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/copy/package.json#L97) files within the output directory for seamless consumption.

### Automated Release Workflow

The automated release process is managed by the script at [`scripts/release.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js), which orchestrates the steps required to publish new versions of the Swiper library. This script streamlines the release workflow, ensuring consistency in versioning, documentation updates, and deployment to the npm registry.

The process begins with an interactive prompt for the new version number, allowing for specification of alpha, beta, or next release tags. This input drives subsequent actions, including updating the [`version`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L102) field in the primary [`package.json`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L479) file. Additionally, dependencies are transferred from the root [`package.json`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L479) to the child [`package.json`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L479) and a [`releaseDate`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js#L19) is added to the child configuration.

Following the version and metadata updates, the script executes a series of Git operations. This involves pulling the latest changes from the repository, staging all modified files, committing these changes with a release-specific message, pushing the commit to the remote repository, and finally, creating and pushing a Git tag corresponding to the new version.

Before publishing, the script ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed ([`npm i`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L31)) and then triggers a production build of the library by running [`npm run build:prod`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L112). This step generates the compiled and optimized assets required for the release. For a detailed understanding of this build process, refer to [Build Process Orchestration](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-build-process-orchestration).

Finally, the script publishes the built package to the npm registry. Depending on the version tag provided at the outset (e.g., 'beta', 'next'), the [`npm publish`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js#L90) command will include the appropriate [`--tag`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/release.js#L100) option, ensuring the package is correctly categorized within npm. The script uses asynchronous command execution to manage these operations.

The process for managing sponsor information within the Swiper project involves fetching current data, processing it, and dynamically updating relevant documentation files. This ensures that financial contributors are recognized and that their support is prominently displayed.

The script responsible for this process, [`scripts/build-sponsors.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-sponsors.js), retrieves sponsor data from a remote API. This data includes information such as the sponsor's name, URL, logo, and the tier of their contribution. Once fetched, the script organizes these sponsors based on their contribution plan (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Sponsor, Top Supporter).

After categorization, the script generates two types of formatted output:

*   An HTML table for a broad display of sponsors, typically used for those at lower tiers, which includes their logos and links.
*   Markdown-formatted lists for specific tiers, such as Silver and general Sponsors, providing direct links to their respective platforms.

These generated tables and lists are then inserted into [`BACKERS.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/BACKERS.md) and [`README.md`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md). This dynamic updating is facilitated by placeholder comments within these Markdown files, allowing the script to inject the latest sponsor information without overwriting other static content. This approach ensures that the project's documentation remains current with its community support.

### Development File Watcher

The file watcher script, located at [`scripts/watch.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js), provides a development utility for automatically rebuilding portions of the Swiper library when source files are modified. This script monitors changes within the [`src`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src) directory, enabling an incremental build process that reduces development time by avoiding full rebuilds for every minor change.

When a file change is detected, the script debounces the event to prevent excessive rebuilds from rapid-fire edits. The core logic then determines the type of build required based on the file extension:

*   Changes to CSS files trigger a rebuild of the styles through [`buildStyles`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-styles.js#L45). Further details on this process are available in [CSS Style Processing and Generation](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-css-style-processing-and-generation).
*   Modifications to TypeScript declaration files ([`.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L19)) initiate a rebuild of the type definitions via [`buildTypes`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-types.js#L11). The generation of these types is further elaborated in [TypeScript Declaration File Generation](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-typescript-declaration-file-generation).
*   Updates to JavaScript module files ([`.mjs`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L463) or [`.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/.eslintrc.cjs#L45)) lead to a rebuild of the JavaScript modules using [`buildModules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/build-modules.js#L16). The bundling and minification process for these modules is described in [JavaScript Module Bundling and Minification](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#swiper-library-development-and-release-javascript-module-bundling-and-minification).

This targeted rebuilding mechanism ensures that only the necessary components are recompiled, enhancing the efficiency of the development workflow.

Swiper Core Implementation and Styling
--------------------------------------

The Swiper library provides a mobile-first touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions and native-like behavior, designed for modern web, web, and hybrid applications. Its core implementation centers on a modular architecture that combines foundational styling with a comprehensive TypeScript type system, facilitating robust and scalable development.

The foundational styling for Swiper components is defined in [`src/swiper.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css). This CSS file establishes the overall layout, positioning, and visual presentation of the slider, including how it handles horizontal and vertical directions, slide appearance, dynamic height adjustments, and 3D effects. It employs CSS custom properties, such as [`--swiper-theme-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2105) and [`--swiper-wrapper-transition-timing-function`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L814), to enable flexible theming and customization. An alternative CSS-driven scroll-snap mechanism is also provided through the [`.swiper-css-mode`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L90) class, leveraging native browser capabilities for a scrollable experience. Further theming options are available via Less variables defined in [`src/swiper-vars.less`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-vars.less).

TypeScript type definitions, located primarily in the [`src/types`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types) directory, are crucial for ensuring type safety and enhancing the development experience. The core [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class, defined in [`src/types/swiper-class.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts), outlines the properties and methods available for interacting with a Swiper instance. This includes managing slide states, controlling navigation, and updating the slider's layout. The type system also encompasses event handling through [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts), which aggregates core Swiper events with those from its various modules. Configuration options for a Swiper instance are comprehensively defined by the [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface in [`src/types/swiper-options.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts), covering aspects like core settings, layout, interaction, transition effects, and responsive design. This modular approach to type definitions extends to individual Swiper modules, with detailed types for their methods, events, and options, all aggregated and re-exported through a public API to provide unified access. Utility functions for handling Swiper effects are declared in [`src/swiper-effect-utils.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-effect-utils.d.ts).

Additionally, the library offers integrations with popular JavaScript frameworks. TypeScript types for React integration are provided in [`src/swiper-react.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-react.d.ts), defining [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) and [`SwiperSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.mjs#L264) components along with hooks like [`useSwiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/context.mjs#L7) and [`useSwiperSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/context.mjs#L3). Similarly, Vue components and composables for Swiper are defined in [`src/swiper-vue.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-vue.d.ts), offering [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) and [`SwiperSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.mjs#L264) components, as well as [`useSwiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/context.mjs#L7) and [`useSwiperSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/context.mjs#L3) composable functions for Vue applications. For web components, [`src/swiper-element.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.d.ts) defines interfaces for custom elements like [`swiper-container`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L173) and [`swiper-slide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L819), complete with their properties, methods, and event maps. The core [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class is re-exported from [`src/swiper.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.d.ts) for flexible import mechanisms.

### Core Swiper Styling and Theming

| Component/Class | Purpose | Customizable CSS Variables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:root` | Defines global CSS variables for theming. | `--swiper-theme-color` (default: `#007aff`) |
| `.swiper` | Core container for the Swiper instance. Establishes basic layout and overflow. | None directly; influenced by `--swiper-theme-color` for preloader. |
| `.swiper-wrapper` | Contains all slides, enabling animated transitions. | `--swiper-wrapper-transition-timing-function` |
| `.swiper-slide` | Individual slide element within the Swiper. | None directly |
| `.swiper-lazy-preloader` | Styling for the lazy load preloader animation. | `--swiper-preloader-color` (defaults to `--swiper-theme-color`) |
| `.swiper-3d` | Applies 3D transform styles for effects. | None |
| `.swiper-css-mode` | Enables CSS-based scrolling and snapping for improved performance and accessibility. | `--swiper-centered-offset-before`, `--swiper-centered-offset-after` |

The fundamental CSS for Swiper components, primarily defined in [`src/swiper.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css), establishes the visual presentation and behavioral properties for the main Swiper container, its wrapper, and individual slides. This includes the setup of the main [`.swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L15) container and its [`.swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L29) for flexible slide display, managing automatic margins, positioning, and [`z-index`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13).

Styling adapts for both horizontal ([`.swiper-horizontal`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L44)) and vertical ([`.swiper-vertical`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L47)) swiping, affecting [`flex-direction`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2173) for the wrapper and [`touch-action`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387) properties to optimize touch interactions. Individual slides, represented by [`.swiper-slide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L50), have their base appearance defined for uniform sizing and transitions, with specific handling for invisible slides ([`.swiper-slide-invisible-blank`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L58)). Dynamic height adjustments are supported for auto-height carousels ([`.swiper-autoheight`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L62)), which modify slide and wrapper heights accordingly.

For 3D effects, the stylesheet implements [`transform-style: preserve-3d`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L79) and [`perspective`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.mjs#L13) on the [`.swiper-3d`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L81) container and its slides. Shadow elements ([`.swiper-slide-shadow`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L156), [`.swiper-slide-shadow-left`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L157), etc.) used in 3D effects also receive defined styles.

An alternative layout approach, [`.swiper-css-mode`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L90), leverages native CSS scroll snap features for a scrollable experience. This mode controls overflow, hides scrollbars, and defines [`scroll-snap-align`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L100) and [`scroll-snap-type`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L104) for different configurations, including horizontal, vertical, free mode, and centered layouts.

The styling also includes a preloader spinner ([`.swiper-lazy-preloader`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L190)) with customizable colors through [`--swiper-preloader-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2182) and an animation ([`swiper-preloader-spin`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L208)). CSS custom properties, such as [`--swiper-theme-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2105) and [`--swiper-wrapper-transition-timing-function`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L814), are defined within [`:root`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L1) to allow for consistent theming and straightforward customization of the component's appearance and transition timing. Additionally, [`src/swiper-vars.less`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-vars.less) defines a Less variable, [`@themeColor`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-vars.less#L1), further supporting consistent theming.

Swiper's modular architecture allows for the extension of its core slider functionality through various modules, each with specific styling to achieve distinct visual effects and behaviors. These modules, located primarily under the [`src/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules) directory, integrate their CSS directly into the Swiper framework, ensuring a cohesive look and feel while enabling a wide range of use cases.

The styling for these modules addresses layout, positioning, directional handling, and responsive design, often leveraging CSS custom properties for theming. For example, modules like navigation and pagination define their appearance using variables such as [`--swiper-navigation-size`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2188) and [`--swiper-pagination-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2184), allowing for global customization.

Various modules implement specific visual effects:

*   **Cards Effect**: The Cards effect, defined in [`src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.css), uses [`overflow: visible`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L353) on the container and [`transform-origin: center bottom`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L127) on slides to create a stacked, card-like appearance with overlapping elements. [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) prevents visual artifacts during transformations.
*   **Creative Effect**: The Creative effect, styled via [`src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css), optimizes slide transitions using [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) and [`overflow: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L360) to prevent visual glitches. It also specifies [`transition-property: transform, opacity, height`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css#L5) to ensure smooth animations for these properties.
*   **Cube Effect**: The Cube effect in [`src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.css) manipulates [`visibility`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L254) and [`pointer-events`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L410) for active and adjacent slides, along with [`transform-origin`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L199) (adjusted for RTL) to create a 3D cube rotation. It also styles [`swiper-cube-shadow`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L84) elements to enhance the volumetric illusion.
*   **Fade Effect**: The Fade effect, controlled by [`src/modules/effect-fade/effect-fade.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-fade/effect-fade.css), primarily uses [`transition-property: opacity`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-fade/effect-fade.css#L9) to manage slide transparency and [`pointer-events`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L410) to ensure only the active slide is interactive.
*   **Flip Effect**: The Flip effect, detailed in [`src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css), also manages [`pointer-events`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L410) for active slides and utilizes [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) on elements involved in the 3D flip transition to prevent rendering issues. [`z-index`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13) is used to correctly layer slides and their shadows.

Other modules focus on enhancing user interaction and accessibility:

*   **Accessibility (A11y)**: The accessibility module, specifically [`src/modules/a11y/a11y.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.css), ensures that [`swiper-notification`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.css#L2) elements are visually hidden ([`opacity: 0`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1769), [`pointer-events: none`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387), [`z-index: -1000`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13)) but remain accessible to assistive technologies, supporting an inclusive user experience.
*   **Grid Layout**: The grid module, defined in [`src/modules/grid/grid.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css), enables multi-row or multi-column slide layouts by applying [`flex-wrap: wrap`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css#L2) and [`flex-direction: column`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1397) to the [`swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L405) element.
*   **Navigation**: The navigation module styles the [`swiper-button-prev`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L390) and [`swiper-button-next`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L391) elements in [`src/modules/navigation/navigation.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.css). It handles their positioning, appearance for disabled and hidden states, and adjusts icon rotation for horizontal, vertical, and RTL layouts.
*   **Pagination**: The pagination module, described in [`src/modules/pagination/pagination.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css), provides styling for various pagination types, including bullets, fractions, and progress bars. It supports dynamic scaling of bullets and handles layout variations for horizontal and vertical orientations.
*   **Scrollbar**: The scrollbar module, styled in [`src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css), defines the visual presentation and behavior of custom scrollbars, including the main track and draggable handle, for both horizontal and vertical Swipers.
*   **Virtual Slides**: For virtualized content, the module's styling in [`src/modules/virtual/virtual.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css) uses hardware acceleration ([`-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; transform: translateZ(0);`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css#L2)) for performance. In CSS mode, it employs a pseudo-element within the [`swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L405) with a dynamically controlled width or height ([`--swiper-virtual-size`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css#L17)) to manage the overall visual size of the virtualized content without rendering all slides.
*   **Zoom**: The zoom module, in [`src/modules/zoom/zoom.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css), styles the [`swiper-zoom-container`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1351) to center zoomable content and sets [`cursor: move`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css#L21) and [`touch-action: none`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387) on [`swiper-slide-zoomed`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css#L20) elements to facilitate custom drag and pan interactions.

While modules like autoplay, controller, coverflow, hash navigation, history, keyboard, manipulation, mousewheel, parallax, and thumbs also exist, their respective CSS files (e.g., [`src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.css), [`src/modules/hash-navigation/hash-navigation.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/hash-navigation/hash-navigation.css), [`src/modules/thumbs/thumbs.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/thumbs/thumbs.css)) are currently empty, implying their styling is either handled by core Swiper CSS, managed via JavaScript, or not yet implemented.

### Accessibility Module Styling

.swiper.swiper-notification { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; pointer-events: none; opacity: 0; z-index: -1000; }

The accessibility module focuses on ensuring that [`swiper-notification`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.css#L2) elements are perceivable by assistive technologies while remaining visually unobtrusive. This is achieved through CSS rules defined in [`src/modules/a11y/a11y.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.css), which apply [`opacity: 0`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1769), [`pointer-events: none`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387), and [`z-index: -1000`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13) to these notifications. By making the elements invisible and non-interactive to sighted users, the module maintains a clean visual interface while still allowing screen readers to access and announce important updates or status changes within the Swiper component, thereby promoting an inclusive user experience.

### Advanced Effect Styling: Cards, Creative, Cube, and Flip

| CSS Property | Cards Effect | Creative Effect | Cube Effect | Flip Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `overflow` | `visible` (on `.swiper`) | `hidden` | `visible` (on `.swiper`), `hidden` | `visible` (on `.swiper`) |
| `transform-origin` | `center bottom` | - | `0 0` (or `100% 0` for RTL) | - |
| `backface-visibility` | `hidden` | `hidden` | `hidden` | `hidden` |
| `pointer-events` | - | - | `none` (default), `auto` (for active/nearby slides) | `none` (default), `auto` (for active slides) |
| `z-index` | - | - | `1` (slides), `0` (shadows) | `1` (slides), `0` (shadows) |
| `transition-property` | - | `transform`, `opacity`, `height` | - | - |
| `visibility` | - | - | `hidden` (default), `visible` (for active/nearby slides) | - |

The styling for Swiper's advanced visual effects, including 'Cards', 'Creative', 'Cube', and 'Flip', manages transformations, visibility, and layering to create distinct slide behaviors. For the 'Cards' effect, the styling in [`src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.css) ensures that the Swiper container allows for visible overflow, enabling slides to overlap and create a stacked card appearance. Individual slides have their [`transform-origin`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L199) set to [`center bottom`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L127), so transformations rotate them from their bottom edge. [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) prevents the back of a rotating card from showing, while [`overflow: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L360) clips content that extends beyond the slide boundaries.

The 'Creative' effect, styled in [`src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css), optimizes slide transitions for smooth animations. [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) is used to enhance performance and rendering during 3D transformations. [`overflow: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L360) clips content outside the slide boundaries, and [`transition-property: transform, opacity, height`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-creative/effect-creative.css#L5) ensures that changes to these properties animate smoothly, contributing to the effect's dynamic visuals.

The 'Cube' effect, defined in [`src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.css), creates a 3D cube transition. Slides are initially hidden and non-interactive. Only the active, next, and previous slides become visible and interactive, using [`pointer-events: auto`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L40) and [`visibility: visible`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L206). The [`transform-origin`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L199) is set to [`0 0`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L5) (or [`100% 0`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L62) for RTL layouts) for correct 3D rotation. Styling also includes [`swiper-cube-shadow`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L84) elements to create a blurred dark background, enhancing the shadow effect. Nested slides are managed to prevent unintended interactions, and [`z-index`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13) values are carefully applied to ensure correct layering of slides and shadows.

The 'Flip' effect, styled in [`src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css), manages [`pointer-events`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L410), [`backface-visibility`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L72), and [`z-index`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13) to create the illusion of a flipping card. Inactive slides have [`pointer-events: none`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387) to prevent interaction, while the active slide gains [`pointer-events: auto`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L40). [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) is applied to prevent visual artifacts during the 3D flip. Shadows associated with the flip effect, such as [`.swiper-slide-shadow-flip`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css#L22) and its variants, are given [`z-index: 0`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L13) and [`backface-visibility: hidden`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L70) to ensure they appear correctly behind the slides. The [`overflow: visible`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L353) on the [`swiper.swiper-flip`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-flip/effect-flip.css#L1) container suggests that the effect may involve elements temporarily extending beyond the container's bounds.

### Grid Layout Module Styling

.swiper-grid>.swiper-wrapper { flex-wrap: wrap; } .swiper-grid-column>.swiper-wrapper { flex-wrap: wrap; flex-direction: column; }

The grid module within Swiper enables the creation of both horizontal and vertical grid-based layouts using CSS flexbox properties. The styling for this module is defined in [`src/modules/grid/grid.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css). When a Swiper container has the [`swiper-grid`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css#L1) class, its internal [`swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L405) element is configured with [`flex-wrap: wrap;`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css#L2), allowing slides to arrange themselves into multiple rows. For vertical, column-based layouts, the [`swiper-grid-column`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css#L4) class is applied, which similarly sets [`flex-wrap: wrap;`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/grid/grid.css#L2) but additionally specifies [`flex-direction: column;`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L27) on the [`swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L405) to orient the slides vertically.

### Navigation, Pagination, and Scrollbar Styling

| Component Type | CSS File | Example Custom Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation (Prev/Next Buttons) | `navigation/navigation.css` | `--swiper-navigation-size`, `--swiper-navigation-color`, `--swiper-navigation-sides-offset` |
| Pagination (Bullets) | `pagination/pagination.css` | `--swiper-pagination-bullet-size`, `--swiper-pagination-bullet-inactive-color`, `--swiper-pagination-color` |
| Pagination (Fraction) | `pagination/pagination.css` | `--swiper-pagination-fraction-color` |
| Pagination (Progress Bar) | `pagination/pagination.css` | `--swiper-pagination-progressbar-bg-color`, `--swiper-pagination-progressbar-size` |
| Scrollbar | `scrollbar/scrollbar.css` | `--swiper-scrollbar-size`, `--swiper-scrollbar-bg-color`, `--swiper-scrollbar-drag-bg-color`, `--swiper-scrollbar-border-radius` |

Swiper's visual components for navigation, pagination, and scrollbars are styled comprehensively to ensure a consistent look and feel across different configurations and orientations. These styling definitions manage appearance, positioning, and interactive states, leveraging CSS custom properties for extensive customization.

Navigation buttons, specifically the previous and next controls, are styled within [`src/modules/navigation/navigation.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.css). This CSS defines their size, cursor, alignment, and visual presentation. It also specifies how these buttons appear in disabled or hidden states, reducing their opacity and disabling pointer events when not active. The styling adapts to both horizontal and vertical Swiper layouts, adjusting positioning and rotating navigation icons to correctly indicate direction, including support for Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts. The [`.swiper-button-lock`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.css#L45) class provides a mechanism to hide buttons when navigation is not required.

Pagination components, which can manifest as bullets, fractions, or progress bars, are styled in [`src/modules/pagination/pagination.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css). The primary container, [`.swiper-pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L22), is absolutely positioned and centered, with transitions for opacity changes. Individual bullets, handled by [`.swiper-pagination-bullet`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L73), are styled with configurable dimensions and colors. The active bullet ([`.swiper-pagination-bullet-active`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L95)) has distinct visual properties. For dynamic bullet pagination, the [`.swiper-pagination-bullets-dynamic`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L47) class manages scaling and transformation of bullets to create an animated "wave" effect around the active slide. Fraction pagination ([`.swiper-pagination-fraction`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L37)) provides text-based numbering, while progress bar pagination ([`.swiper-pagination-progressbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L148)) visually indicates progress with a fill that scales based on slide progression. Like navigation, pagination styles are adjusted for both horizontal and vertical Swiper orientations, and extensive use of CSS variables (e.g., [`--swiper-pagination-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2184), [`--swiper-pagination-bullet-size`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.css#L74)) enables broad customization.

Scrollbars, detailed in [`src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css), define the appearance of both the scrollbar track ([`.swiper-scrollbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L14)) and its draggable handle ([`.swiper-scrollbar-drag`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L45)). The styling covers positioning, sizing, and background colors, using CSS custom properties (e.g., [`--swiper-scrollbar-border-radius`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L15), [`--swiper-scrollbar-bg-color`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L19)) to control their visual presentation. Rules are included for horizontal and vertical scrollbar orientations, ensuring correct layout and appearance. Utility classes like [`.swiper-scrollbar-disabled`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L21) and [`.swiper-scrollbar-lock`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.css#L57) allow for disabling or completely hiding the scrollbar when it's not needed.

### Virtual Slides Module Styling and Optimization

.swiper-virtual.swiper-slide { -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; transform: translateZ(0); } .swiper-virtual.swiper-css-mode { .swiper-wrapper::after { content: ''; position: absolute; pointer-events: none; } } .swiper-virtual.swiper-css-mode.swiper-horizontal { .swiper-wrapper::after { height: 1px; width: var(--swiper-virtual-size); } } .swiper-virtual.swiper-css-mode.swiper-vertical { .swiper-wrapper::after { width: 1px; height: var(--swiper-virtual-size); } }

The virtual slides module optimizes Swiper's rendering performance, particularly for large numbers of slides, by leveraging hardware acceleration and strategic CSS management. Performance is enhanced by applying CSS properties such as [`-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css#L2) and [`transform: translateZ(0);`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L71) to virtual slides, as defined in [`src/modules/virtual/virtual.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css). These properties encourage browsers to utilize hardware acceleration for smoother animations and transitions.

When Swiper operates in CSS mode with virtual slides, the module employs a pseudo-element within the [`.swiper-wrapper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper.css#L29) to represent the total visual size of the virtualized content. This avoids the need to render every slide in the DOM, which can be resource-intensive. The pseudo-element's [`width`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L43) or [`height`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L44) dynamically adjusts based on a [`--swiper-virtual-size`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.css#L17) CSS variable, which is set according to the calculated total size of the virtual content. This approach efficiently manages the visual footprint of the Swiper instance without directly manipulating individual slide elements, thereby contributing to efficient rendering and overall performance.

### Zoom Module Styling

.swiper-zoom-container { width: 100%; height: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; text-align: center; >img, > svg, >canvas { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; object-fit: contain; } } .swiper-slide-zoomed { cursor: move; touch-action: none; }

The Swiper zoom module's styling, defined in [`src/modules/zoom/zoom.css`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css), focuses on enhancing the user experience when interacting with zoomable content within a slider. The [`.swiper-zoom-container`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css#L2) class is responsible for visually preparing the content for zooming by centering images, SVGs, or canvases within their container. It also ensures that the content fills the available space while maintaining its aspect ratio. When a slide is in a zoomed state, the [`.swiper-slide-zoomed`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.css#L20) class is applied. This class alters the cursor to a [`move`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L38) icon, providing a visual cue that the content can be panned, and disables default touch actions with [`touch-action: none`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L387). This allows for custom handling of touch gestures, which is critical for an effective zoom and pan experience.

TypeScript Type Definitions
---------------------------

TypeScript type definitions for the Swiper library reside in the [`src/types`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types) directory, providing a comprehensive set of interfaces to ensure type safety and enhance developer experience. These definitions encompass core Swiper functionalities, event handling, configuration options, and module-specific extensions.

The primary entry point for all type definitions is [`src/types/index.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/index.d.ts), which re-exports types from various specialized files. Essential shared utility types, such as [`CSSSelector`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts#L3) and [`SwiperModule`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts#L5) (a type representing the structure of Swiper modules), are defined in [`src/types/shared.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts).

The core [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class interface, responsible for defining the public API of a Swiper instance, is established in [`src/types/swiper-class.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts). This interface integrates properties and methods from all Swiper modules, offering a unified access point to control the slider's state, navigate slides, and manage its lifecycle. It also provides the [`SwiperClass<Events>`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts#L28) interface for consistent event handling across the library.

All possible events emitted by a Swiper instance and its modules are consolidated within the [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) interface, defined in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts). This interface combines core Swiper events related to lifecycle, user interaction, and transitions with module-specific events, enabling type-safe registration of event listeners.

Configuration options for a Swiper instance are detailed in the [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface in [`src/types/swiper-options.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts). This interface covers a broad spectrum of settings, including core properties, layout, interaction, transition effects, responsive behavior, and accessibility features. It also integrates module-specific options, allowing developers to configure features like autoplay, navigation, pagination, and various visual effects.

Module-specific type definitions are systematically organized within the [`src/types/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules) directory. Each module (e.g., A11y, Autoplay, Controller, various Effect modules, Navigation, Pagination, Virtual, Zoom) has its own dedicated [`.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L19) file, which defines its specific methods, events, and configuration options. These individual module types are then aggregated and re-exported through [`src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts) and [`src/types/modules/index.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/index.d.ts), providing a unified entry point for all module-related type definitions. This modular structure promotes clear organization and simplifies type management for Swiper's extensive functionalities.

The Swiper library's TypeScript type definitions establish a foundational structure for both its core functionalities and its modular extensions. The primary entry point for these definitions is located at [`src/types/index.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/index.d.ts), which aggregates and re-exports types from various specialized files.

Central to the type system is the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class interface, defined in [`src/types/swiper-class.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-class.d.ts). This interface outlines the comprehensive public API of a Swiper instance, including properties that represent the slider's current state (e.g., [`activeIndex`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/shared/process-lazy-preloader.mjs#L40), [`isBeginning`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L157)), methods for programmatic control (e.g., [`slideNext`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/slide/slideNext.mjs#L2), [`slideTo`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/slide/slideTo.mjs#L4), [`update`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L395)), and event handling capabilities through methods like [`on`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L105) and [`emit`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L233). A key aspect of the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) interface is its integration of module-specific functionalities directly into the main class. This means that methods and properties introduced by modules such as A11y, Autoplay, or Navigation are directly accessible via the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) instance, providing a unified and consistent API for developers. The class also includes a static [`use`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L727) method, enabling dynamic module installation.

Shared utility types, located in [`src/types/shared.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts), provide common definitions used throughout the library. This includes [`CSSSelector`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts#L3) for type-safe CSS selector strings and [`SwiperModule`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/shared.d.ts#L5), which defines the expected structure for Swiper modules, ensuring they adhere to a consistent interface for integration.

The [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) interface, detailed in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts), specifies all possible events emitted by a Swiper instance. This includes core events related to the slider's lifecycle and user interactions, as well as events contributed by individual modules, ensuring type safety for event handling across the entire library.

Configuration options are managed through the [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface in [`src/types/swiper-options.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts). This extensive interface defines all configurable parameters for a Swiper instance, covering core settings, layout, interaction, effects, responsive design, and the seamless integration of module-specific options. Developers can configure features like [`autoplay`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.mjs#L5), [`navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6), or [`pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11) either by enabling them with a boolean [`true`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L17) for default settings or by providing detailed option objects.

This modular and layered approach to type definition ensures that developers using TypeScript benefit from strong type checking, autocompletion, and clear documentation, whether they are interacting with the core Swiper functionality or its numerous extensions. Further details on module-specific types can be found in [Module-Specific Type Definitions and Public API](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#typescript-type-definitions-module-specific-type-definitions-and-public-api).

### Swiper Event Type Definitions

The [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) interface, defined in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts), serves as a centralized type definition for all events emitted by a Swiper instance and its integrated modules. This interface consolidates core Swiper events, such as [`init`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L564) (fired after initialization), [`slideChange`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L73) (when the active slide changes), [`touchStart`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L118), [`touchMove`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L123), [`touchEnd`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L138) (for user interaction), and [`resize`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/modules/resize/resize.mjs#L3) (for responsiveness), with events specific to various Swiper modules.

By extending module-specific event interfaces like [`A11yEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts#L3), [`AutoplayEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L40), [`NavigationEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/navigation.d.ts#L31), [`PaginationEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/pagination.d.ts#L38), and various effect-related events (e.g., [`FadeEffectEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-fade.d.ts#L3), [`CubeEffectEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-cube.d.ts#L3)), [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) provides a comprehensive and type-safe mechanism for event handling. This design ensures that developers can access a complete list of possible events and their corresponding callback signatures, facilitating robust and predictable event-driven interactions within Swiper applications. For example, when an [`autoplay`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.mjs#L5) event occurs, the associated callback receives the [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) instance as an argument, while an [`autoplayTimeLeft`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L60) event provides additional details like the remaining time and percentage. This structured approach to event typing streamlines development by offering clear guidance on event payloads and available actions. The overall architecture for Swiper's TypeScript definitions is further elaborated in [TypeScript Type Definitions](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#typescript-type-definitions).

### Swiper Options and Module Configuration Types

The [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface, defined in [`src/types/swiper-options.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts), provides a comprehensive configuration model for a Swiper instance, acting as the central hub for customizing its behavior, appearance, and responsiveness. This interface consolidates core slider properties with an extensive set of module-specific configurations, ensuring type safety and clarity for developers.

At its core, [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) manages fundamental slider characteristics such as initialization ([`init`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L564)), whether it's enabled, its scrolling direction ([`direction`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L32)), and the speed of transitions ([`speed`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L37)). It also defines layout and sizing aspects like the number of slides visible per view ([`slidesPerView`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/shared/process-lazy-preloader.mjs#L36)) and spacing between slides ([`spaceBetween`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L56)). User interaction is configured through properties like [`simulateTouch`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L72), which controls touch simulation on desktop, and [`allowTouchMove`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/zoom/zoom.mjs#L246), which enables or disables touch-based navigation.

The interface also supports various visual transition effects through the [`effect`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L53) property, which can be set to values like [`'fade'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/defaults.mjs#L43), [`'cube'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/defaults.mjs#L43), [`'coverflow'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/defaults.mjs#L43), or [`'flip'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L2525). Each of these effects can be further fine-tuned with its own dedicated option object, such as [`fadeEffect`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L125) or [`cubeEffect`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L124), which are themselves interfaces defined within the [`src/types/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules) directory. This modular approach allows for rich, customized visual presentations.

A crucial aspect of [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) is its seamless integration with Swiper's modular architecture. Many properties within [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) correspond directly to Swiper modules, such as [`a11y`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.mjs#L10) for accessibility, [`autoplay`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.mjs#L5) for automatic slide transitions, [`navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6) for control buttons, and [`pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11) for visual indicators. These module-specific properties can be enabled by simply setting them to [`true`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L17), or they can accept a detailed configuration object (e.g., [`A11yOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts#L5), [`AutoplayOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L79), [`NavigationOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/navigation.d.ts#L50), [`PaginationOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/pagination.d.ts#L60)) to provide fine-grained control over the module's behavior. This allows developers to activate and customize features like keyboard control, mousewheel navigation, parallax effects, and zoom functionality directly through the main options object.

For responsive design, [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) includes a [`breakpoints`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L44) property, allowing different configurations to be applied based on specified screen widths or container sizes. This ensures the slider adapts gracefully to various viewing environments.

Event handling is also central to [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27), with the [`on`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L105) property allowing developers to register callback functions for a multitude of events emitted by the Swiper instance and its modules. These events are formally defined in the [`SwiperEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts#L26) interface in [`src/types/swiper-events.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-events.d.ts), providing a type-safe mechanism for reacting to slider lifecycle changes and user interactions. Further details on event handling can be found in [Swiper Event Type Definitions](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#typescript-type-definitions-swiper-event-type-definitions).

### Module-Specific Type Definitions and Public API

The Swiper library adopts a modular approach for its extended functionalities, with each feature, such as accessibility or various visual effects, defined as a distinct module. To support type-safe development, each of these modules has its own dedicated TypeScript type definition file within the [`src/types/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules) directory. These files define the specific methods, events, and configuration options associated with that module.

For instance, the Autoplay module's functionalities are defined in [`src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts), which includes [`AutoplayMethods`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L3) for programmatic control (e.g., [`pause()`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L22), [`resume()`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/events/onResize.mjs#L47)), [`AutoplayEvents`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L40) for handling lifecycle events (e.g., [`autoplayStart`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L44), [`autoplayStop`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L48)), and [`AutoplayOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/autoplay.d.ts#L79) for configuring behavior (e.g., [`delay`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.mjs#L15), [`disableOnInteraction`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/autoplay/autoplay.mjs#L17)). Similarly, [`src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts) provides [`A11yOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/a11y.d.ts#L5) to configure accessibility features like screen reader messages and ARIA attributes, utilizing placeholders for dynamic content. Effect modules like Cards, Creative, Cube, Fade, and Flip each have their own [`.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/scripts/watch.js#L19) files (e.g., [`src/types/modules/effect-cards.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-cards.d.ts), [`src/types/modules/effect-creative.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-creative.d.ts)), detailing their unique options such as [`slideShadows`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.mjs#L7), [`rotate`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.mjs#L11), or complex [`CreativeEffectTransform`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-creative.d.ts#L1) properties.

To provide a unified and convenient access point for all module-related type definitions, the library aggregates these individual module types. The [`src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/public-api.d.ts) file serves as a central re-export mechanism, making all module interfaces available from a single import path. This design simplifies type management for developers, allowing them to import all necessary Swiper module types comprehensively. Furthermore, the core [`SwiperOptions`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/swiper-options.d.ts#L27) interface, as detailed in [Swiper Options and Module Configuration Types](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#typescript-type-definitions-swiper-options-and-module-configuration-types), seamlessly integrates these module-specific options, allowing them to be configured directly within the main Swiper instance options. This modularity ensures clarity, maintainability, and a robust type-checking experience for developers leveraging Swiper's extensive feature set.

The [`demos`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos) directory provides a collection of examples illustrating the various functionalities and usage patterns of the Swiper library. These demonstrations showcase how to implement core features, configure different navigation and pagination types, integrate scrollbars, and manage slide layouts.

Basic usage is demonstrated by initializing a default [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) instance, as seen in [`demos/010-default.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/010-default.html). Navigation options include next/previous buttons, shown in [`demos/020-navigation.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/020-navigation.html). Multiple pagination types are covered, such as standard dots ([`demos/030-pagination.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/030-pagination.html)), dynamic bullets ([`demos/040-pagination-dynamic.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/040-pagination-dynamic.html)), a progress bar ([`demos/050-pagination-progress.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/050-pagination-progress.html)), fractional display ([`demos/060-pagination-fraction.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/060-pagination-fraction.html)), and custom-rendered bullets ([`demos/070-pagination-custom.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/070-pagination-custom.html)). The integration of a scrollbar is presented in [`demos/080-scrollbar.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/080-scrollbar.html).

Layout configurations for slides include vertical orientation ([`demos/090-vertical.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/090-vertical.html)), custom spacing between slides ([`demos/100-space-between.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/100-space-between.html)), and displaying multiple slides per view ([`demos/110-slides-per-view.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/110-slides-per-view.html)). The library also supports automatically adjusting the number of visible slides based on their width ([`demos/120-slides-per-view-auto.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/120-slides-per-view-auto.html)), centering active slides ([`demos/130-centered.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/130-centered.html)), and combining centered and auto-sized slides ([`demos/140-centered-auto.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/140-centered-auto.html)).

Further demonstrations explore advanced behaviors, such as CSS-based transitions for enhanced performance ([`demos/145-css-mode.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/145-css-mode.html)), free-mode scrolling without snapping ([`demos/150-freemode.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/150-freemode.html)), and configuring Swiper to act as a scroll container for long content ([`demos/160-scroll-container.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/160-scroll-container.html)). The library's capability to arrange slides in a multi-row grid layout is shown in [`demos/170-slides-per-column.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/170-slides-per-column.html). Nesting multiple Swiper instances with different orientations is also possible, as illustrated by the horizontal and vertical nested Swipers in [`demos/180-nested.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/180-nested.html). The [`grabCursor`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L42) option, which provides visual feedback for draggable content, is showcased in [`demos/190-grab-cursor.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/190-grab-cursor.html).

| Creative | `/nolimits4web/swiper/demos/257-effect-creative.html` | Highly customizable effect with various 3D transitions. Multiple examples demonstrate different `prev` and `next` slide animations. | `grabCursor`, `creativeEffect` (including `shadow`, `translate`, `rotate`, `origin`) |

The Swiper library offers a variety of advanced visual effects and transitions that extend beyond basic sliding behavior, allowing for complex and engaging user experiences. These effects transform how slides appear and interact during transitions, often leveraging 3D transformations for depth and dynamism. Demonstrations of these effects are provided in the [`demos`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos) directory, showcasing their configuration and visual output.

The **fade effect**, as seen in [`demos/220-effect-fade.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/220-effect-fade.html), provides a smooth, cross-fading transition between slides. This effect de-emphasizes motion and instead focuses on the gradual appearance and disappearance of content, making it suitable for galleries or presentations where subtle transitions are preferred.

For a more three-dimensional experience, the **cube effect** ([`demos/230-effect-cube.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/230-effect-cube.html)) rotates slides as if they are faces of a cube. This involves manipulating each slide's [`shadow`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.mjs#L8) and [`shadowScale`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cube/effect-cube.mjs#L10) properties, which define the visual depth and shading during the 3D rotation, giving the impression of a solid object turning.

The **coverflow effect** ([`demos/240-effect-coverflow.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/240-effect-coverflow.html)) arranges slides in a 3D arc, fanning them out like a deck of cards. Its configuration involves properties such as [`rotate`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.mjs#L11), [`stretch`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-coverflow/effect-coverflow.mjs#L10), and [`depth`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-coverflow/effect-coverflow.mjs#L11), which control the angle of rotation, the spacing between slides along the Z-axis, and the perceived depth of the effect. This creates a visually striking layered presentation where inactive slides are partially visible and recede into the background.

The **flip effect** ([`demos/250-effect-flip.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/250-effect-flip.html)) causes slides to flip over to reveal the next or previous content, akin to turning a page. This effect utilizes 3D transformations that pivot the slide, providing a dynamic and attention-grabbing transition.

A visually distinct **cards effect** ([`demos/255-effect-cards.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/255-effect-cards.html)) presents slides as a stack of cards, where the active slide is at the forefront and others are partially hidden behind it, sliding into view one by one. This creates a sense of depth and interaction with the slide stack.

Finally, the **creative effect** ([`demos/257-effect-creative.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/257-effect-creative.html)) offers highly customizable transitions by allowing fine-grained control over the [`translate`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L38), [`rotate`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/effect-cards/effect-cards.mjs#L11), and [`origin`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/types/modules/effect-creative.d.ts#L7) properties of both previous and next slides. This enables a wide range of unique animations, from slides moving in complex 3D paths to rotating around custom origins, facilitating highly bespoke visual behaviors. Multiple instances of this effect demonstrate its versatility, each configured to showcase a different animation style.

### Dynamic Swiper Management and Integration Patterns

Advanced Swiper usage patterns are demonstrated through various examples that highlight dynamic slide manipulation, synchronized displays, and integration with browser navigation systems. One such demonstration illustrates how slides can be added or removed dynamically at runtime using [`prependSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.mjs#L264) and [`appendSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/virtual/virtual.mjs#L254) methods, providing a flexible way to manage carousel content programmatically.

Another common pattern involves synchronizing multiple Swiper instances, as seen in the synchronized thumbnail gallery example. This setup typically includes a main Swiper for large image display and a smaller Swiper for thumbnails, where interactions with one carousel automatically update the other. The [`thumbs`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L777) option facilitates this linkage, ensuring that navigating the main slider updates the active thumbnail and vice-versa.

Integration with browser navigation is also showcased. The hash navigation feature ([`hashNavigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L129)) allows the Swiper's active slide to be linked to the URL's hash fragment, enabling direct linking to specific slides and maintaining browsing state. Similarly, the history integration ([`history`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/history/history.mjs#L3)) demonstrates how slide changes can update the browser's history API, allowing users to navigate through slides using the browser's back and forward buttons.

Finally, the capability to manage multiple independent Swiper instances on a single page is presented, demonstrating that the library can handle diverse carousel configurations without interference. Each instance operates with its own settings for pagination, navigation, and effects, proving the modularity and flexibility of the Swiper library for complex layouts. All these demonstrations can be explored in the [`demos`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos) directory.

### Accessibility and Performance Enhancements

| Feature | Configuration Option | Demonstration File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS Mode | `cssMode: true` | `demos/145-css-mode.html` |
| Keyboard Control | `keyboard: { enabled: true }` or `keyboard: true` | `demos/260-keyboard-control.html`, `demos/145-css-mode.html` |
| Mousewheel Control | `mousewheel: true` | `demos/270-mousewheel-control.html`, `demos/145-css-mode.html` |
| RTL Support | `dir="rtl"` attribute on swiper container | `demos/350-rtl.html` |
| Parallax | `parallax: true` | `demos/360-parallax.html` |

Swiper includes various features aimed at enhancing user experience and performance, as demonstrated in the [`demos`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos) directory. Keyboard and mousewheel controls provide alternative navigation methods, while CSS-based transitions optimize rendering. Additionally, the library supports right-to-left (RTL) language layouts and can implement parallax effects for visual depth.

Keyboard control allows users to navigate through slides using arrow keys. This is enabled by configuring the [`keyboard`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/keyboard/keyboard.mjs#L5) option to [`enabled: true`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L396) in the Swiper instance, as shown in [`demos/260-keyboard-control.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/260-keyboard-control.html). Similarly, mousewheel navigation is activated by setting [`mousewheel: true`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L396), allowing users to scroll through slides with a mousewheel, particularly useful for vertical carousels as illustrated in [`demos/270-mousewheel-control.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/270-mousewheel-control.html).

For performance optimization, Swiper can leverage CSS for transitions by setting [`cssMode: true`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L396), which offloads animations to the browser's rendering engine. This can result in smoother transitions and reduced JavaScript overhead, especially on lower-powered devices. An example of this can be seen in [`demos/145-css-mode.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/145-css-mode.html).

Swiper also supports Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts, which is important for languages like Arabic and Hebrew. By setting [`dir="rtl"`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/211-slides-per-group-skip.html#L104) on the Swiper's container element, the library automatically adjusts its layout and navigation direction to accommodate RTL text flow, as demonstrated in [`demos/350-rtl.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/350-rtl.html).

Finally, parallax effects can be integrated into Swiper slides to create a sense of depth and immersion. Elements within slides can be assigned [`data-swiper-parallax`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/360-parallax.html#L13) attributes to control their movement relative to the slide, as illustrated in [`demos/360-parallax.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/360-parallax.html). This effect works by manipulating the position of elements based on the slider's scroll progress.

The [`playground`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground) directory offers an environment for developing and testing the Swiper carousel library, encompassing core functionalities and integrations with contemporary web frameworks. This setup showcases Swiper's capabilities across vanilla JavaScript, Web Components, React, and Vue.js, employing Vite for efficient local development and module resolution.

Each subdirectory within [`playground`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground) focuses on a distinct integration pattern:

*   The [`playground/core`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/core) environment demonstrates fundamental Swiper functionalities using a single JavaScript instance. The [`playground/core/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/core/index.html) file initializes a Swiper instance with features such as pagination, navigation buttons, and a scrollbar. The associated [`playground/core/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/core/vite.config.js) configures Vite to alias the [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) module to a local distribution, enabling seamless testing of local Swiper builds.
*   For Web Components integration, the [`playground/element`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element) directory utilizes custom elements like [`swiper-container`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L173) and [`swiper-slide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L819) directly within [`playground/element/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/index.html). These elements become functional through the [`register`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.mjs#L297) function imported from [`swiper/element/bundle`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/index.html#L41). Similar to the core setup, [`playground/element/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/vite.config.js) handles module aliasing for local development.
*   The React integration is showcased in [`playground/react`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react). The [`playground/react/App.jsx`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx) component renders a [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) instance from [`swiper/swiper-react`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L6), demonstrating integration with modules like [`Pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11), [`Mousewheel`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/mousewheel/mousewheel.mjs#L5), [`Navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6), and [`Scrollbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.mjs#L7). The [`playground/react/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/vite.config.js) file ensures that [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) imports resolve to the local distribution.
*   The Vue.js integration, located in [`playground/vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue), features the [`playground/vue/App.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue) component. This component uses the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) component from [`swiper/swiper-vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue#L29) with various modules, including [`A11y`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.mjs#L10). It also includes [`playground/vue/innerComp.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/innerComp.vue) to demonstrate programmatic control over the Swiper instance. The [`playground/vue/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/vite.config.js) is configured to alias [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) to the local distribution, facilitating development.

In all these configurations, Vite's module aliasing functionality, configured in the respective `vite.config.js` files, plays a crucial role. It directs [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) imports to locally built distribution files, allowing developers to test changes to the Swiper library immediately without requiring a full release or complex [`node_modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/.npmignore#L5) linking. This setup streamlines the development workflow and supports rapid iteration on the Swiper library.

### Core Swiper Development Environment

export default { resolve: { alias: { swiper: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../dist/'), }, }, };

The core Swiper development environment is configured to demonstrate fundamental carousel functionalities and facilitate local development of the Swiper library. The primary demonstration resides in [`playground/core/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/core/index.html), which initializes a Swiper instance showcasing essential features like pagination, navigation buttons, and a scrollbar. This HTML file imports the necessary Swiper CSS and JavaScript and instantiates the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) class, which is made globally accessible as [`window.swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue#L41).

The development environment is supported by a Vite configuration file at [`playground/core/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/core/vite.config.js). This file sets up a development server that is accessible across a local network ([`host: '0.0.0.0'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/demos/vite.config.js#L5)) and, crucially, defines a module alias. The alias maps the [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) import directly to the [`../../dist/`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/vite.config.js#L8) directory, allowing developers to test changes to the Swiper library locally without needing to publish it or rely on [`node_modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/.npmignore#L5). This setup ensures that ongoing development and testing of the library can occur against the latest local builds.

### Web Components Integration Playground

<body><swiper-container navigation><swiper-slide>Slide 1</swiper-slide><swiper-slide>Slide 2</swiper-slide><swiper-slide>Slide 3</swiper-slide><swiper-slide>Slide 5</swiper-slide></swiper-container><style></style><script type="module">import { register } from'swiper/element/bundle'; register(); </script></body>

The Web Components integration playground demonstrates the use of Swiper via custom HTML elements, providing a declarative way to incorporate a carousel. This is showcased in [`playground/element/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/index.html), where the [`swiper-container`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L173) element serves as the main wrapper for the carousel and [`swiper-slide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L819) elements define individual slides. These custom elements are made functional by invoking the [`register`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.mjs#L297) function, which is imported from [`swiper/element/bundle`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/index.html#L41). This approach allows developers to define a Swiper instance directly within HTML markup, simplifying initial setup.

To facilitate local development and testing, the playground utilizes Vite. The configuration in [`playground/element/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/vite.config.js) sets up module aliases that redirect imports for various Swiper modules, such as [`swiper/element/bundle`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/element/index.html#L41) and [`swiper/bundle`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1971), to local distribution files. This ensures that the demonstration environment uses the most current local builds of the Swiper library, which is critical for developers making changes to the library itself. For additional information on the development environment, see [Development and Testing Playground](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#development-and-testing-playground).

### React Framework Integration Playground

The React playground provides an environment for demonstrating and developing Swiper within a React application. The application's entry point is defined in [`playground/react/main.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/main.js), which renders the main [`App`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L8) component. The [`App`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L8) component, located in [`playground/react/App.jsx`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx), integrates the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) carousel from [`swiper/swiper-react`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/App.jsx#L6). This integration showcases how various Swiper modules, such as [`Pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11), [`Mousewheel`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/mousewheel/mousewheel.mjs#L5), [`Navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6), and [`Scrollbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.mjs#L7), can be utilized by importing them from [`swiper/modules`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L456) and passing them as props to the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) component.

For local development, the playground leverages [`playground/react/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/vite.config.js) to configure Vite's module aliasing. This setup allows [`import 'swiper'`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L242) statements to resolve to the local distribution path within [`(root)`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/), facilitating immediate testing of changes made to the Swiper library without requiring a new package publication. The foundational HTML structure for the React application, including viewport settings and the mount point for the React app, is defined in [`playground/react/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/react/index.html).

### Vue.js Framework Integration Playground

The [`playground/vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue) directory contains a Vue.js application that serves as a development and testing environment for the Swiper library. This setup demonstrates how the core application in [`playground/vue/App.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue) integrates Swiper components and modules, how [`playground/vue/innerComp.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/innerComp.vue) offers programmatic control over the slider, and how the Vite configuration file facilitates local development by aliasing the Swiper library.

The main application, defined in [`playground/vue/App.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue), utilizes the [`Swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) component from [`swiper/swiper-vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue#L29) to create a carousel. It configures properties such as [`slidesPerView`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/shared/process-lazy-preloader.mjs#L36), [`spaceBetween`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper.mjs#L56), [`navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6), [`scrollbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.mjs#L7), and [`pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11) to define the carousel's appearance and behavior. It also integrates various Swiper modules, including [`Navigation`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/navigation/navigation.mjs#L6), [`Pagination`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/pagination/pagination.mjs#L11), [`Scrollbar`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/scrollbar/scrollbar.mjs#L7), and [`A11y`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/modules/a11y/a11y.mjs#L10), demonstrating how these features can be enabled. The [`onSwiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/react/swiper.mjs#L28) event handler provides access to the Swiper instance, which is also exposed globally for debugging.

Within [`playground/vue/App.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/App.vue), the [`playground/vue/innerComp.vue`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/innerComp.vue) component is used inside a [`SwiperSlide`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/swiper-element.mjs#L264) to demonstrate programmatic control and display slide-specific properties. This component injects the main Swiper instance and slide properties like [`isActive`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper-slide.mjs#L72) and [`isNext`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/vue/swiper-slide.mjs#L75). It includes a button that, when clicked, calls [`swiper.slideNext()`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/innerComp.vue#L3) to advance the carousel. This illustrates how individual components can interact with the Swiper instance to modify its state.

The development environment is configured using [`playground/vue/vite.config.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/vite.config.js). This Vite configuration file sets up the Vue plugin and establishes a path alias for [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51). By mapping the [`swiper`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/src/core/core.mjs#L51) import to a local [`dist/`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/README.md?plain=1#L90) directory, the project can use a locally built version of the Swiper library. This is critical for testing changes made to the Swiper library itself, enabling immediate feedback within the Vue application playground. The application's entry point is [`playground/vue/main.js`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/main.js), which imports CSS for styling and mounts the Vue application to the DOM. The [`playground/vue/index.html`](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/blob/ec4977b629c0823173e7b8bde7feb040a9fc4ff3/playground/vue/index.html) provides the basic HTML structure and styling for the Swiper container and slides. For further details on the development environment, see [Development and Testing Playground](https://codewiki.google/github.com/nolimits4web/swiper#development-and-testing-playground).
